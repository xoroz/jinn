## What is Jinn?

Jinn is an open-source AI gateway that wraps the Claude Code CLI, Codex SDK,
and Gemini CLI behind a unified daemon process. It routes tasks to AI engines,
manages connectors like Slack, and schedules background work via cron. Jinn is
a bus, not a brain.

## 💡 Why Jinn?

Most AI agent frameworks reinvent the wheel — custom tool-calling loops, brittle context management, hand-rolled retry logic. Then they charge you per API call on top.

**Jinn takes a different approach.** It wraps battle-tested professional CLI tools (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI) and adds only what they're missing: routing, scheduling, connectors, and an org system.

### 🔑 Works with your Anthropic Max subscription

Because Jinn uses **Claude Code CLI under the hood** — Anthropic's own first-party tool — it works with the [$200/mo Max subscription](https://www.anthropic.com/pricing). No per-token API billing. No surprise $500 invoices. Flat rate, unlimited usage.

Other frameworks can't do this. Anthropic [banned third-party tools from using Max subscription OAuth tokens](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/bedrock-vertex#max-plan) in January 2026. Since Jinn delegates to the official CLI, it's fully supported.

### 🧞 Jinn vs OpenClaw

| | Jinn | OpenClaw |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Wraps professional CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini) | Custom agentic loop |
| **Max subscription** | ✅ Works (uses official Claude Code CLI) | ❌ Banned since Jan 2026 |
| **Typical cost** | $200/mo flat (Max) or pay-per-use | $300–750/mo API bills ([reported by users](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenClaw/)) |
| **Security** | Inherits Claude Code's security model | 512 vulnerabilities found by CrowdStrike |
| **Memory & context** | Handled natively by Claude Code | Custom implementation with [known context-drop bugs](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/5429) |
| **Cron scheduling** | ✅ Built-in, hot-reloadable | ❌ [Fires in wrong agent context](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/16053) |
| **Slack integration** | ✅ Thread-aware, reaction workflow | ❌ [Drops agent-to-agent messages](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/issues/15836) |
| **Multi-agent org** | Departments, ranks, managers, boards | Flat agent list |
| **Self-modification** | Agents can edit their own config at runtime | Limited |

### 🧠 The "bus, not brain" philosophy

Jinn adds **zero custom AI logic**. No prompt engineering layer. No opinions on how agents should think. All intelligence comes from the engines themselves — Claude Code already handles tool use, file editing, multi-step reasoning, and memory. Jinn just connects it to the outside world.

When Claude Code gets better, Jinn gets better — automatically.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```

The CLI sends commands to the gateway daemon. The daemon dispatches work to AI
engines (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI), manages connector integrations, runs
scheduled cron jobs, and serves the web dashboard.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Jinn reads its configuration from `~/.jinn/config.yaml`. An example:

```yaml
gateway:
  port: 7777

engines:
  claude:
    enabled: true
  codex:
    enabled: false

connectors:
  slack:
    enabled: true
    app_token: xapp-...
    bot_token: xoxb-...

cron:
  jobs:
    - name: daily-review
      schedule: "0 9 * * *"
      task: "Review open PRs"

org:
  agents:
    - name: reviewer
      role: code-review
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```
jinn/
  packages/
    jimmy/          # Core gateway daemon + CLI
    web/            # Web dashboard (frontend)
  turbo.json        # Turborepo build configuration
  pnpm-workspace.yaml
  tsconfig.base.json
```

## 🧑‍💻 Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hristo2612/jinn.git
cd jinn
pnpm install
pnpm setup   # one-time: builds all packages and creates ~/.jinn
pnpm dev     # starts gateway + Next.js dev server with hot reload
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the web dashboard.

`pnpm dev` starts two servers behind the scenes: the **gateway daemon** on
`:7777` (API, WebSocket, connectors) and the **Next.js dev server** on `:3000`
(web dashboard with hot reload). Next.js rewrites proxy `/api/*` and `/ws`
requests from `:3000` to the gateway, so you only need to visit `:3000`. The
gateway auto-restarts when you edit backend source files via Node's built-in
`--watch` mode. To use a non-default gateway port, set `GATEWAY_PORT=<port>`
before running `pnpm dev`.

> **Prerequisites:** Node.js 22+, pnpm 10+, and the
> [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`).
