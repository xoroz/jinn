# Jarvis Overview

Jarvis is a lightweight AI gateway daemon that wraps professional AI CLI tools as "engines." It is published as `jinn-cli`.

## Core Principle

**Jarvis is a bus, not a brain.** All AI intelligence comes from the engines natively. Jarvis adds no custom agentic loop, no prompt engineering layer, no opinions on how AI should behave. It delegates everything to professional tools (Claude Code CLI, Codex SDK) and focuses solely on routing, scheduling, and connectivity.

## What Jarvis Does

- **Gateway**: Single Node.js process that accepts messages from multiple sources and routes them to AI engines
- **Connectors**: Modular input/output adapters (Slack, web UI, future: Discord, iMessage)
- **Cron**: Scheduled AI jobs with hot-reloadable configuration
- **Organization**: Employee personas with departments, ranks, and inter-agent communication via boards
- **Skills**: Markdown instruction sets that engines read and follow natively
- **Self-modification**: Jarvis can edit its own config, skills, cron jobs, and org structure at runtime

## How It Differs from Custom Agentic Frameworks

Traditional approaches build custom tool-calling loops, manage context windows, and implement retry logic. Jarvis does none of that. The engines (Claude Code, Codex) already handle tool use, file editing, command execution, and multi-step reasoning. Jarvis just connects them to the outside world.
